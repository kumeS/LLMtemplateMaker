Your definition should be in the {function} format and include specific elements such as @title, @description, @param, @importFrom, @return, @export, @author {author}, and @examples.
It is important to make sure that the function name you define is also defined in @export.
In addition, you should translate any comments in the function (starting with #') to English and make sure that the content of the comments is consistent and correct throughout the function.
If you find any errors or areas for improvement in the R script, you should correct them according to these instructions.
If there is a risk of errors occurring during text generation, you should make the necessary changes to prevent these errors.
Once you have completed the definition, please submit it as a final product.
You should use the assertthat::is.string, assertthat::is.count, assertthat::noNA, and other function groups in the assertthat package, and append the data verification execution command to the function according to the type of argument.
You should omit the R code output.
